**Welcome!**

This project is a part of a course called "Project Work - Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence and Data" at DTU. It addresses the topic of virtual versus physical lectures. We measured heart rates of students and teacher during both types of lectures, and aim to investigate whether Inter-Subject Correlation of Heart Rate predicts learning experience in a classroom setting.

The heart rate data was obtained using FirstBeat Pro devices and is imported and processed using the scripts in this branch.
